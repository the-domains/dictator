Finishing my 3rd Xmas anniversary in InspiringHK,  I still remember the number of participants has grown from ~30  in 2013 to ~400 today. I was asked so many times about who are the beneficiaries of your charity. I said the kids, but was wrong. Parents, students, mentors, coaches, donors, sports ambassadors, supports, of course us, all of the people!
